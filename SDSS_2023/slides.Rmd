## Research Questions

- How are potential jurors' perceptions of evidence affected by the use of algorithms and images?

    - How can we tell which portions of the testimony participants focus on?
    
    - What can we do when Likert response scales suffer from scale compression?
    
    - How can we create a more engaging testimony format that clarifies the actors?

### Why Algorithms in Forensic Science?

- President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) Report (2016)
  - Current methods of pattern analysis (such as bullet matching) are subjective 
     - based on the training and experience of forensic examiners
     - No national standard (Baldwin, 2014)
     
  - Issues in Scientific Validity
     - error rate studies
         - How to report inconclusives (Hofmann et al., 2021)
         - Open set vs. closed set
        
  - Scale of Conclusions
     - What match language is appropriate?
     
 
---

class: primary-blue
### Why Algorithms in Forensic Science?

- Foundational Validity (PCAST definition)

  - Reproducible and consistent procedure for identifying and comparing features to determine identification between two samples
  
  - empirical measurements from multiple independent studies of false positive rate and sensitivity
 
---

class: primary-blue
### Why Algorithms in the Courtroom?
#### Concern about Interpretability
- FRStat testimony using probabilistic language:
  - "The probability of observing this amount of correspondence is approximately [XXX] times greater when the impressions are made by the same source rather than by different sources" (Defense Forensic Science Center)
  - Jurors struggle with distinguishing between a wide range of values (between 10 and 100,000)
    when estimating the likelihood that the defendant was involved in the crime (Garrett et. al. 2018) 
- A study in DNA (Koehler)
  - More likely to believe subject was the source of the DNA when presented with a probability rather than a frequency
  - Asked participants how many individuals would match DNA for a given match proportion in a population of 500,000. Correct answers:
     - 60.7% for frequency
     - 42.1% for probability
- Examiners may be easier to understand (Swofford & Champod 2022)
  - Supplement examiner testimony with a statistical comparison

## The Structure

- Based on Garrett et. al.'s "Mock jurors' evaluation of firearm examiner testimony" (2020)
    - Richard Cole is on trial for attempted robbery of a convenience store
    - Gun found in Cole's car is tested against bullet recovered from crime scene
    
- Three Variables: 
    - Demonstrative Evidence 
    - Algorithm 
        - Algorithm testimony includes both a Firearm Examiner and an Algorithm Expert
    - Conclusion

- Gathering Data
    - 569 participants from Prolific (using representative sample feature)
    
- Questions on the reliability/credibility of the evidence or the expert

## The Algorithm

.pull-left[
- Described in Hare et. al.
- A 3D scan is taken of each bullet land, a stable cross section is extracted, and shoulders are removed
- A smoothing function is applied twice in order to extract the signature, which can be compared to land signatures from other bullets
- Traits (cross correlation, matching extrema, number of nonmatches, etc.) are used in a random forest to produce a match score for lands. Lands are aligned across bullets in order to compute an overall match score for the bullets

## The Results

- Conviction choice
  - 10/196 (5%) for Non-match
  - 13/191 (7%) for Inconclusive
  - 112/182 (62%) for Match

## Moving Forward

- Scale Compression
  - Ceiling effect: examiners are overall seen as reliable
  - Individuals may already believe that firearms evidence is reliable (Garrett & Mitchell, 2013)
  - Proposed Solution: Investigate other response methods
  
- Written Testimony
  - Not representative of a courtroom setting
  - Can be confusing
  - Proposed Partial Solution: Include characters to clarify actors
  
- Notepad analysis

# How can we tell which portions of the testimony participants focus on?

---

class: primary-blue
### Digital Notepad

.img[![](images/notepad.jpg)]

- Participants are provided with a digital notepad, and input is saved for each page of testimony
  - Data cleaning: removing the previous page's notes before analysis
  
  .img[![](images/pagecleaning_plain.jpg)]

---

class: primary-blue
### First n Characters

- Test edit distance on first n characters to previous notes
   - Edit distance: Number of changes necessary to go from one string to the other string
   - Hat -> Hot requires 1 substitution (edit distance of 1)
   - Over there -> there requires 5 deletions (edit distance of 5)

.img[![](images/pagecleaning.jpg)]

- What if:
   - Participants delete portions of their previous notes?
   - Participants add new notes in the middle of/before their old notes?
   - Participants duplicate their old notes?
---

class: primary-blue
### Longest Common Substring (LCS)

- Search for the longest common substring between the current set of notes and the previous set of notes
   - If the string is long enough, remove from current page of notes
   - Repeat

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
grViz("digraph {
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = TB]
  
  node [shape = rectangle]        
  rec1 [label = 'Page 1\n the cat enjoys napping in the afternoon']
  rec2 [label = 'Page 2\nWhen it is quiet, the cat enjoys napping']
  rec3 [label =  'LCS\n the cat enjoys napping']
  rec4 [label = 'Page 2 Clean\nWhen it is quiet']
  
  # edge definitions with the node IDs
  rec1 -> rec3
  rec2 -> rec3
  rec3 -> rec4
  }",
  height = 500, width=800)

```

---

class: primary-blue
### Longest Common Substring (LCS)

What if...
- Participants delete portions of their previous notes?
   
Page 1 | Page 2 | LCS | Edit Distance
--------|---------|---------|---------
The cat ran up the tree | The cat ran | The cat ran | 12

- Participants add new notes in the middle of old notes?
   
Page 1 | Page 2 | LCS | Edit Distance
--------|---------|---------|---------
The cat ran up the tree | <mark>The cat ran, chased by a</mark> dog, up the tree | (The cat ran)(up the tree) | 11

- Participants duplicate their old notes?
   
Page 1 | Page 2 | LCS | Edit Distance
--------|---------|---------|---------
The cat ran up the tree | <mark>The cat ran up the tree</mark> The cat ran up the tree | (The cat ran up the tree)(The cat ran up the tree) | 0

---

class: primary-blue
### Hybrid Method

- LCS Drawbacks
   - What if testimony itself is repeated?
   - Time intensive
- Use the first n character method for easy cases, then clean up difficult cases with LCS (Tested on subset of 35 participants' notes)

<img src="images/cleaningerror.jpg" width="75%" />

---

class: primary-blue
### Hybrid Method

- Difficult Cases
   - Edit distance larger than the initial cutoff value
   - Note length more than 4 standard deviations above the mean length for that page

### How can we tell which portions of the testimony participants focus on?

- Highlight testimony based on frequency of occurrence in participants' notes
  - Collocations of length 5
     - Willfully: average frequency of 91.2
- Next step: fuzzy matches

### What can we do when Likert response scales have scale compression?

- Micro-study comparing response formats
  - Strength of evidence (Likert - 9 point)
  - Guilt (Yes/No)
  - Convict (Yes/No)
  - Probability of guilt (Numeric)
  - What are the chances that defendant committed the crime? (Numeric or multiple choice)
  - How much would you be willing to bet that the defendant committed the crime? (Numeric)
  
- Inclusion of jury instructions and more cross examination on subjectivity

### How can we create a more engaging testimony format that clarifies the actors?

- Development of figures (by Richy Meleus) with text bubbles, and colors indicating which side they are testifying for
